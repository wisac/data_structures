# Data Structures Repository

This repository contains C++ implementations of various data structures, including singly linked lists (sLinkedList), doubly linked lists (dLinkedList), and a templated stack. Each implementation is designed for integer data types and provides fundamental operations and features for their respective data structures.

## Introduction

This repository showcases implementations of classic data structures in C++. The goal is to provide clear and flexible implementations that can be used as building blocks for various applications.

## Features

- Implementations of singly linked lists (sLinkedList) and doubly linked lists (dLinkedList) for integer data types.
- A templated stack implementation that supports basic operations and is flexible with different data types.
- Detailed error handling using C++ exceptions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the `sLinkedList.h`, `dLinkedList.h`, and `stack.h` header files in their folders.
3. Include the relevant header file in your C++ project based on the data structure you want to use.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the data structures:

### Singly Linked List (sLinkedList)

Refer to README in the ***singly_linkedl_list*** folder.


### Doubly Linked List (dLinkedList)

Refer to README in the ***doubly_linkedl_list*** folder

### Stack
Refer to README in the ***stack*** folder


### Documentation
Both Betty-style and Doxygen-style documentation have been used for the code implementations in this repository. Please refer to the comments within the source files for detailed documentation.
